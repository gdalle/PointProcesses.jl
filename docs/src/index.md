# PointProcesses.jl

Welcome to the documentation of [PointProcesses.jl](https://github.com/gdalle/PointProcesses.jl), a package for modeling, simulation and inference with temporal point processes.

## Getting started

To install the latest release available in the General registry, run the following code in Julia's REPL:

```julia
import Pkg; Pkg.add("PointProcesses")
```

To install the current development version, run this code instead:

```julia
import Pkg; Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/gdalle/PointProcesses.jl")
```

## Mathematical background

Temporal point processes are a way to describe collections of events with time stamps.
Please refer to the tutorial [rasmussen2018](@cite) for details.
